I love Minecraft, the simplicity and mindless playing allows me to relax.
But I wanted to program it, and decided to checkout how easy it is to write a mod for it.

So I write a super simple mod which thought me about server `<->` client communication. 
I knew a little Java, so it was a weekend me warming up my Java skills and learning the mod API called Forge.
