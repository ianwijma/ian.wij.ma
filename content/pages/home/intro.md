Welcome and thanks for visiting my humble place on the internet.

Here you can find my projects, blog and information about me.
In the future I will also host fun projects to try out here.

**About me**

I'm Ian Wijma from The Netherlands, and currently living in Canberra, Australia. 
I moved to Australia in 2019.

**Passions**

*Programming*

This is my hobby and my profession. 
In my spare time I love trying out new and exciting new languages like GO, Rust, Deno and C#.
Where at work I mainly use JavaScript with sprinkles of PHP.

*Craft beer*

I love trying out new craft beer from local and international brewers. 
Any new location has its own brewers with their beers to try out.
I'm also starting to read into brewing my own beers. So stay tuned about potential blog posts about that.

*Traveling*

I love traveling, about 7 years ago, when I was still living in The Netherlands, I always went to France.
But ever since I went to Dublin and Scotland I got the travel fever. 
Countries I'd love to visit are Japan, India, Russia and Canada.
I also want to travel around Europe more, visit friend from Sweden, Denmark and England. 

*Gaming*

Gaming for me is a way to wind down my head after a busy day of programming. 
Where after I feel relaxed and ready to get some good sleep. 

*FOSS*

Free Open Source Software is great, I always look at project to contribute to.
During a busy work week I don't get much time to do so. 
But during my holidays I love checking out projects that I can start or help.
