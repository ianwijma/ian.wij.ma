Hey you,

Thanks you for checking out my website. 
Here you can find more information about myself. 
Where I will tell about myself, what my passions are and what my skils are.

**About me**

I'm Ian Wijma, born on 17th of Juli 1993 in The Netherlands, and currently living in Canberra, Australia.
My passions are programming, traveling, gaming and craft beers. 
I love exploring the unknown in all my passions, meaning I love trying new beers, 
exploring new places and trying out exiting new programming languages.

**Skillz**

I have great communication skills, where I love talking with people about my passions.
I'm not shy if it comes to meeting new people, 
and love talking with people of different backgrounds.

As I said I love trying new programming languages, where my root come from JavaScript/TypeScript and PHP. 
Other languages that interest me are Rust, Go and C#. Where I have several projects with languages on my [Github](https://github.com/ianwijma).

I also love Linux and its eco system. 
Where I take proud that all my devices run Linux, where I migrated my Gaming PC in 2020.
I also have experience running Linux based servers, and some experience running docker.
