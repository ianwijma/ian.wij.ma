**Communication**

I consider myself to have good communication skills, 
and I love meeting new people of different backgrounds.
I have many friends from all over the world as I mentioned before.
Where I love seeing differences between different parts of the world.

`Teamwork` 

**Project/Product focused**

I'm because of my works very product focused, 
and love to know the scope of the whole product so decisions are easy to make.
Were I often know the actual code from the top of my head.

**Programming**

I consider myself very capable in programming. 
I'm not focused on one language which makes it relatively easy for me to pickup a new language.
I learn myself programming concepts instead the language.

Saying this I find myself skilled in JavaScript because I have been programming with this languages 8 years as a hobby, 
and 5 years professionally.
This allows me to know various gotchas, like shrinking an array in JavaScript can be done via setting the `array.length = 5;`

**Linux**

I love Linux and I have been using it personally for 6 years and professionally for 5 years.
Where since beginning 2019 I personally run fully on Linux, where I migrated my gaming PC to POP!_OS 20.04.
I also have experience running Linux server. Where Debian is my operating system of choice.

**Workaholic**

Yep, This is not a skill I'm proud of,
But once I'm going on a project I'm excited for I sometimes work long hours. 
In my current job I used to make easily 12+ hours days for a week long.

Now I have stopped doing such a long hours due to pay, 
I still see myself work for hours on personal projects.
