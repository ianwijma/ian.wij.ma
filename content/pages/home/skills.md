**Communication**

I consider myself to have good communication skills, 
and I love meeting new people of different backgrounds.
I have many friends from all over the world as I mentioned before.
Where I love seeing differences between different parts of the world.

**Teamwork**

Teamwork is very important for me and love practising it.
Teamwork to me is obvious working in a team, 
as a group who understands each others standpoint and view.
I also have lots of experience working and interactive with people from different origins,
due to the fact that I have friends all over the worlds which I have met up with. 

**Project/Product focused**

I'm because of my works very product focused, 
and love to know the scope of the whole product so decisions are easy to make.
Were I often know the actual code from the top of my head.

**Programming**

I consider myself very capable in programming. 
I'm not focused on one language which makes it relatively easy for me to pickup a new language.
I learn myself programming concepts instead the language.

Saying this I find myself skilled in JavaScript because I have been programming with this languages over a decade and a half as a hobby, and since 2015 professionally.
This allows me to know various gotchas, like shrinking an array in JavaScript can be done via setting the `array.length = 5;`

**Linux**

I love Linux and I have been using it personally for since 2008 and professionally for since 2015.
Where since beginning 2019 I personally run fully on Linux, where I migrated my gaming PC to POP!_OS 20.04.
I also have experience running Linux server. Where Debian/Ubuntu has my preference, but I'm always curious for the next big thing!

**Product development**

I have worked for since 2015 on developing products in SAAS environments, 
Where I have worked on products ranging from HRM solutions to internal social systems for companies to eCommerce with multi channel support.

With the latter one I have 3+ years experience, I have worked on multi channel support ranging from webshop integration to an in-store POS system.
My role here was everything from backend to frontend to sysops.


**Workaholic**

Yep, This is not a skill I'm proud of,
But once I'm going on a project I'm excited for I sometimes work long hours. 
In my current job I used to make easily 12+ hours days for a week long.

Now I have stopped doing such a long hours due to pay, 
I still see myself work for hours on personal projects.
