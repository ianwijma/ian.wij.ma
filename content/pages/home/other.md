**Manager gaming community 2013-2014**

Maybe a silly think to include, 
but I used to be a Manager at a gaming community where I mainly took care of conflicts within the community.
But this was on an American server. 
Where I learned a lot of English speaking and writing. 

I stopped managing after the exams began and required some focus,
and the timezone difference blocked my of resolving conflicts.
