Although I went to a school where I learned to work with hardware and later on learned to program.
The periods where too easy and learned mostly from my own projects.

**ROC Van Twente (IT support) 2010-2012**

IT support was a requirement for me due to my prior education. 
Here I mainly learned the basics of ITIL and some basic hardware.

This course was easy for me because I already worked on hardware 4 years prior to this study, 
where I was tinkering around with several 2nd hard desktops and a 1u server. 

**ROC Van Twente (Programming) 2012-2015**

After the IT support study I was ready for a challenge,
and was excited to get started with C#.
But after a month the pace was slow for myself due to me also playing around with C# at home.
