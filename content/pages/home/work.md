**Albert Heijn (Dutch grocery store) 2010-2013**

I started off with a proper job at the local grocery store,
where I learned allot about teamwork, communication and being organised.
Where after a few months I mainly worked in the warehouse extracting the truck and organising the warehouse.

**StoreKeeper B.V. 2015-today**

After my game development application was a flop I started working for StoreKeeper B.V.
Here I learned allot, but mainly that I need to learn at my own pace. 
Which school are often slow and won't give me a challenge. 

Here I learned professional/technical communication in English due to the fact that the CTO is from Poland.
Where we mainly work with JavaScript, PHP and PostGreSQL on an eCommerce product.
I learned here to combine hardware and software because we have our own POS system. 
with a connection to several web shops using a backend and backoffice to manage it all.
