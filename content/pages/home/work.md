**Atlassian 2024 - present**

As a Software Engineer I found myself excelling at my job. I was put
early on a high stakes project that involved improving the performance
for XL enterprice customers at Atlassian. My day-to-day task is workiPng
in large code bases and technologies that are developed in house, which
I managed to do and spread information about. I love working on
challanging tasks, which enabled me to receive reconision from my
managers and peers of various levels.

**Maropost 2021 - 2024**

As a Tech Lead at Maropost I found myself successfully guiding peers,
working out EPICs to a point where teams understood what and why
certain changes needed to happen. Additionally I've found myself
guiding whole teams from across the business ask for my guidance around
topics like feature toggles and the concept behind writing behavioural
tests. Besides all of this I also worked myself on spikes and tasks to
help the team I worked with to successfully complete sprints.
